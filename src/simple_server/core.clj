;;; Destructuring routes and parameters
;;; Let's see what else we can do with routes.

;; Remember, we currently have this:

(comment
  (defroutes game-routes
    (GET "/new-game" [] (new-game-handler)) ; Why does one have it wrapped in (),
    (GET "/guess"    [] guess-handler)      ; and this one doesn't?
    (ANY "*"         [] (not-found "Sorry, No such URI on this server!"))))

;; What are the empty [], and why do we have (new-game-handler) vs guess-handler ?
(response "Here is some text.")
;;
;; HTTP is often (usually?) used to transfer some specific information,
;; either in the form of query-strings, or post data.  What we had to do
;; with extract-guess is tedious, and we can tell we're going to need to
;; do this a LOT.  So compojure gives us some pretty powerful tools for this.


;;;; Destructuring the request object.

;; What is in the empty [] is actually a destructuring form which
;; gets applied to the (possibly modified) incoming request.

((GET "/foo" request {:status 200 :body request})
 (mock/request :get "/foo?name=Bob"))


;; We can apply the standard map destructuring constructs:
((GET "/foo" {headers :headers} {:status 200 :body headers})
 (mock/request :get "/foo?name=Bob"))

;; or
((GET "/foo"
   {:keys [server-name request-method uri]}
   {:status 200 :body [server-name request-method uri]})
 (mock/request :get "/foo?name=Bob"))


;;;; Extracting parts of the URI

(defn greet-user-handler [name]
  (response (format "Greetings, %s!" name)))

((GET "/foo/:name" [name] (greet-user-handler name))
 (mock/request :get "/foo/Sally"))

;; Compojure, if it sees a vector as the destructuring construct,
;; takes things one step further, and does some magic behind the
;; scenes; in this case, binds any keyword part in the URI path
;; to a symbol of the same name.

;; This is nice, because now we can see how we can start separating
;; our functions which do logic from those that do "http stuff";
;; in particular, we could rewrite above like this:

(defn greet-user [name]
  (format "Greetings, %s!" name))

((GET "/foo/:name" [name] (response (greet-user name)))
 (mock/request :get "/foo/Sally"))
;; {:status 200, :headers {}, :body "Greetings, Sally!"}

;; And, it turns out, if we just return a string, Compojure will interpret
;; that as a success response, so we can actually just write thisÂ¹:

((GET "/foo/:name" [name] (greet-user name))
 (mock/request :get "/foo/Sally"))
;; {:status 200, :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html; charset=utf-8"}, :body "Greetings, Sally!"}


;; 2. extracting query string parameters

;; It would be nice if we could get the data from the query string
;; or post data in a similar way, i.e. write:

((GET "/foo" [name] {:status 200 :body (str "The name is: " name)})
 (mock/request :get "/foo?name=Bob"))

;; To get this to work, we need to discuss /middlewares/.


;; ring.util.response provides some handy shortcuts for creating these maps; e.g.


;; The standard, everything was OK type response:
(response "Here is some text.")
;; {:status 200, :headers {}, :body "Here is some text."}

;; 404 not found:
(not-found "Oops!")
;; {:status 404, :headers {}, :body "Oops!"}

;; With this in mind, let's rewrite some of our handlers.
;; Also, now that we understand that they ARE "handlers",
;; we'll rename them:

(def game-in-progress (atom nil))

(defn extract-guess [qs]
  (when (seq qs)
    (Long. (second (clojure.string/split qs #"=")))))

(defn guess-handler [request]
  (if-let [guess (extract-guess (:query-string request))]
    (cond
      (= guess @game-in-progress)
      (and (reset! game-in-progress (+ 1 (rand-int 10)))
           (response "Congratulations! You win!"))

      (< guess @game-in-progress)
      (response "Too low.")

      (> guess @game-in-progress)
      (response "Too high."))
    ;; Notice, there is no helper for a 400 response, but we can
    ;; easily create one like this:
    (-> (response  "You need to supply a guess with /guess?guess=N")
        (status 400))))

(defn new-game-handler []
  ;; Make our new game:
  (reset! game-in-progress (+ 1 (rand-int 10)))
  (response "OK- start guessing at /guess"))

(defroutes game-routes
  (GET "/new-game" [] (new-game-handler))     ; Why does one have it wrapped in (),
  (GET "/guess"    [] guess-handler)          ; and this one doesn't?
  (ANY "*"         [] (not-found "Sorry, No such URI on this server!"))) ; Our catch all, if nothing matches.

(def handler game-routes)


(defonce server
  (future (run-jetty #'handler {:port 3001 :join false})))
