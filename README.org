* Simple Server

A toy repository to demonstrate important concepts in building
an HTTP api service in clojure.

Based on https://github.com/alain-picard/simple-server-playground

* Usage

  #+begin_src shell
lein repl  
  #+end_src

Should start a server listening on [[http://localhost:3000]]



* HTML Guessing Game

A small guessing game that gives 5 tries to guess a number from 1-10.

*Important URIs:
Login page: [[http://localhost:3000/login]] 
At present, valid username and passwords are:
user    pass
foo     bar
admin   123
egg     man
test    test
Sets a cookie in your browser that expires in 1 hour.

New game: [[http://localhost:3000/new-game]] 
Lets the server start a new game.
It associates the game with your internal user ID, so multiple sessions at once are possible.

Guess: [[http://localhost:3000/guess?guess=N]]
The server will tell you if you guessed too high, too low, or if you got it right.
Replace N with a number from 1 to 10 (eg. ?guess=3) and go to that URL to make the guess.
